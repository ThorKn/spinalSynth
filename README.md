# 1. Introduction

This project implements a compact digital audio synthsizer in SpinalHDL.

The oscillator is based on Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) using a phase accumulator architecture. The oscillator generates audio waveforms internally using an oversampled DDS engine and outputs stereo audio using the I²S protocol.

The project is intentionally designed to remain:

- compact
- deterministic
- FPGA-friendly
- easy to understand
- easy to simulate
- easy to extend later

## Features

- 24-bit DDS phase accumulator
- 480 kHz internal DDS update rate
- 48 kHz stereo audio output
- 16-bit signed audio samples
- Stereo I²S output interface
- Oversampled waveform generation
- Single synchronous 24 MHz clock domain
- Clock-enable based timing architecture
- FPGA-friendly implementation

## AI: ChatGPT and Gemini

The project was developed with the heavy usage of AI tools. All the specification documents were created via talking sessions to chatGPT, most of them in voice chat on the mobile with follow ups on the keyboard.

Impementation, debugging and testing was done in VSCode with the free Gemini Extension.
Later on, i switched the IDE to Antigravity and started paying for Gemini Access (Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash 3.5).

# 3. Master Clock

The complete design operates from a single synchronous master clock.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Master clock frequency | 24 MHz |

No internally-generated FPGA clocks shall be used.

All submodules shall operate synchronously from the 24 MHz master clock using clock-enable tick signals.

---

# 4. Timing Generators

The TimingGenerator module shall generate two independent clock-enable tick signals.

## phaseTick

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Frequency | 480 kHz |
| Divider | 24 MHz / 50 |
| Purpose | Drive DDS phase accumulator |

The phase accumulator and waveform generation logic shall update on this tick.

---

## sampleTick

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Frequency | 48 kHz |
| Divider | 24 MHz / 500 |
| Purpose | Generate output audio samples |

The decimator and output audio sample registers shall update on this tick.

---

# 5. Communication Protocol

The system is controlled via a standard UART interface. An external controller (such as a PC or Microcontroller) sends 3-byte packets to update the internal state of the synthesizer.

## UART Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Baud Rate | 115,200 |
| Data Bits | 8 |
| Parity | None |
| Stop Bits | 1 |

## Packet Format

The `UartProtocolDecoder` expects a 3-byte sequence for every command:

1. **Command Byte**: One byte for the command. (i.e. 0x01 for "write to register")
2. **Address Byte**: Specifies which register to write to.
2. **Data Byte**: The value to be written.

## Command list

Right now there is only one command.

| Command | Name | Adress Byte | Data Byte |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | `WriteRegister` | `From Register Map` | `1 Byte` |


## Register Map

| Address | Register Name | Description | Width |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | `FREQ_LOW` | Frequency Word Bits [7:0] | 8 bit |
| `0x01` | `FREQ_MID` | Frequency Word Bits [15:8] | 8 bit |
| `0x02` | `FREQ_HIGH` | Frequency Word Bits [23:16] | 8 bit |
| `0x03` | `WAVE_SEL` | 0:Saw, 1:Square, 2:PWM, 3:Triangle, 4:Noise | 3 bit |
| `0x04` | `PWM_WIDTH` | Duty cycle for PWM waveform | 8 bit |
| `0x05` | `VOLUME` | Master output volume (Reserved) | 8 bit |

---

# 6. DDS Oscillator Architecture

The oscillator shall use a classic DDS architecture.

## DDS Core

At every phaseTick:

```text
phase := phase + freqWord
```

The phase accumulator shall wrap naturally on overflow.

---

## Phase Accumulator

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Width | 24 bit |
| Type | Unsigned |

Example:

```scala
val phase = Reg(UInt(24 bits))
```

---

## Frequency Word

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Width | 24 bit |
| Type | Unsigned |

The frequency word controls oscillator frequency.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Atomic Multi-Byte Update Protocol:**
> Since the 24-bit frequency word is spread across three 8-bit registers (`FREQ_LOW`, `FREQ_MID`, and `FREQ_HIGH`), updates are buffered atomically to prevent audio glitching:
> 1. Writing to `FREQ_LOW` (`0x00`) stages the lower 8 bits in a temporary shadow register.
> 2. Writing to `FREQ_MID` (`0x01`) stages the middle 8 bits in a temporary shadow register.
> 3. Writing to `FREQ_HIGH` (`0x02`) commits the entire 24-bit frequency word (`High ## MidShadow ## LowShadow`) simultaneously to the active synthesis registers in a single clock cycle.
>
> *Always write registers in order (`FREQ_LOW` → `FREQ_MID` → `FREQ_HIGH`) to ensure consistent updates.*

---

## Frequency Calculation

The DDS frequency equation is:

```text
f = freqWord × updateRate / 2^24
```

Where:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| updateRate | 480 kHz |
| phase width | 24 bit |

---

## Frequency Resolution

The minimum frequency step is:

```text
480000 / 16777216 ≈ 0.0286 Hz
```

# 7. Waveform Generators

The oscillator shall support the following waveforms.

## Saw

Generated by mapping the upper phase bits to audio amplitude.

Example:

```text
sample = phase[23:8]
```

---

## Square

Generated using the phase accumulator MSB.

Example:

```text
if phase[23] == 1:
    +MAX
else:
    -MAX
```

---

## PWM

Generated using a comparator between phase and pulseWidth.

The 8-bit PWM width value shall be expanded internally before comparison with the 24-bit phase accumulator.

The expansion shall be implemented by shifting the PWM value 16 bits to the left to match 24 bits width.

Example:

```text
if phase < pulseWidth:
    +MAX
else:
    -MAX
```

## PWM Width

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Width | 8 bit |
| Type | Unsigned |

---

## Triangle

Generated using reflected phase arithmetic.

To generate the triangle wave, we utilize a "reflected phase" technique based on the 24-bit phase accumulator. The Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the phase acts as a direction indicator: during the first half-cycle (MSB=0), the lower 23 bits create a linear rising ramp, whereas during the second half-cycle (MSB=1), those bits are bitwise inverted to produce a symmetrical falling ramp. This 23-bit result is then right-shifted by 7 bits to normalize it to a 16-bit range and cast to a signed integer (SInt), resulting in a full-swing bipolar waveform that transitions smoothly between peak amplitudes.

---

## Noise

Noise generation shall use an LFSR-based pseudo-random generator.

| Parameter      | Value               |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Generator type | Fibonacci LFSR      |
| Width          | 23 bit              |
| Polynomial     | x^23 + x^18 + 1     |
| Feedback taps  | bit 22 XOR bit 17   |
| Update timing  | `phaseTick`         |
| Output type    | 16-bit signed       |
| Reset seed     | nonzero fixed value |

An LFSR must never be initialized to zero, as it would stay stuck. We will plan to use a fixed non-zero seed.

The 16-bit signed audio is extracted just by taking the upper 16 bits of the LFSR.

---

# 8. Oversampling and Decimation

## Oversampling Strategy

The DDS oscillator shall internally operate at:

```text
480 kHz
```

while the final audio output sample rate shall be:

```text
48 kHz
```

This creates an oversampling ratio of:

```text
10×
```

---

## Decimation Strategy

The implementation shall use simple zero-order decimation.

Every 10th DDS sample shall be captured as the output audio sample.

No interpolation or low-pass filtering shall initially be used.

Example:

```text
if(sampleTick) {
    audioSample := oscSample
}
```

---

# 9. Audio Sample Format

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Audio width | 16 bit |
| Sample format | Signed |
| Sample rate | 48 kHz |

Example:

```scala
val sample = SInt(16 bits)
```

The oscillator is currently mono internally.

The mono signal shall be duplicated to both stereo output channels.

Example:

```text
leftSample  = sample
rightSample = sample
```

---

# 10. I²S Output Interface

The output interface shall use the I²S protocol.

## I²S Timing Architecture

The I²S transmitter shall operate directly from the 24 MHz master clock. The transmitter shall use a cycle-timed state machine architecture.

---

## I²S Bit Timing

The required I²S bit clock frequency BCLK is:

```text
48,000 × 2 × 16 = 1.536 MHz
```

The relationship to the 24 MHz master clock is:

```text
24 MHz / 1.536 MHz = 15.625
```

Therefore no integer divider exists.

The serializer shall therefore alternate between:

- 15 master-clock cycles
- 16 master-clock cycles

between serialized bit transfers.

---

## I²S Timing Subpattern

The serializer shall use the following repeating 8-step timing subpattern:

```text
16,16,15,16,16,15,16,15
```

This subpattern contains:

| Interval | Count |
|---|---|
| 16-cycle intervals | 5 |
| 15-cycle intervals | 3 |

Total clocks:

```text
16+16+15+16+16+15+16+15 = 125
```

Average clocks per bit:

```text
125 / 8 = 15.625
```

This exactly matches the required average I²S bit timing.

---

## Relationship To LRCLK Period

One stereo I²S frame contains:

```text
32 serial bits
```

because:

- 16 left-channel bits
- 16 right-channel bits

Since:

```text
32 = 4 × 8
```

the 8-step timing subpattern repeats exactly four times during one complete stereo frame.

Full frame timing:

```text
[16,16,15,16,16,15,16,15] × 4
```

Total master-clock cycles per stereo frame:

```text
4 × 125 = 500
```

Stereo frame rate:

```text
24 MHz / 500 = 48 kHz
```

This produces the exact required audio sample rate.

---

## I²S Timing State Machine

The serializer shall internally contain:

| Register | Purpose |
|---|---|
| cycleCounter | Current interval countdown |
| patternIndex | Selects 15/16-cycle interval |
| bitCounter | Counts serialized bits |
| shiftRegister | Serialized audio data |

The pattern index shall cycle continuously:

```text
0 → 1 → 2 → ... → 7 → 0
```

The bit counter shall cycle:

```text
0 → 1 → 2 → ... → 31 → 0
```

The bit counter determines:

- LRCLK state
- stereo frame boundaries
- sample reload timing

---

## I²S Audio Format

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Channels | 2 |
| Audio width | 16 bit |
| Sample rate | 48 kHz |
| Bit clock | 1.536 MHz |

---

## I²S Signals

| Signal | Description |
|---|---|
| i2s_bclk | Bit clock |
| i2s_lrclk | Left/right word select |
| i2s_sdata | Serial audio data |

---

## Serializer Behavior

The I²S serializer shall:

- shift audio data 
- serialize stereo audio samples
- generate LRCLK framing
- output signed 16-bit audio samples

The exact serializer state machine behavior is not yet specified.

---

# 11. Numeric Formats

| Signal | Type |
|---|---|
| phase | UInt(24 bits) |
| freqWord | UInt(24 bits) |
| pulseWidth | UInt(8 bits) |
| audioSample | SInt(16 bits) |

The design shall use fixed-point arithmetic throughout.
