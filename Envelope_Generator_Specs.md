# SpinalSynth: Envelope Generator Specification

## Description
The **Envelope Generator** is a control module designed to shape the volume (amplitude) or other modulation parameters of a sound over time. The general design principle is an ADSR engine. In a nutshell, this is how it works:

When a key is pressed (Gate ON), the envelope rises to peak volume (Attack), decays slightly to a steady volume (Decay and Sustain), and then fades to silence when the key is released (Release). 

This module generates envelopes with a 10-bit resolution (0 to 1023) output value, which can be used as a volume (or other modulation) signal.

The entire module is designed with ASIC portability in mind, meaning it uses no specific hardware multipliers or memory blocks. Instead, it relies on compile-time Scala calculators to generate look-up curves in ROM, and performs most intermediate steps using bit-shifts and additions.

## 1. EnvelopeGenerator: Top-Level Wrapper

The top-level `EnvelopeGenerator` module integrates the submodules and registers them to the system communication and audio pipelines.

### Module Interface (I/O Ports)

The top-level `EnvelopeGenerator` operates directly on the 24 MHz main system clock and exposes the following SpinalHDL hardware IO bundle:

```scala
val io = new Bundle {
  // Inputs
  val phaseTick = in Bool()                 // Heartbeat tick synced with 480 kHz sample rate
  val syncIn    = in Bool()                 // External trigger for Hard or Soft Sync
  val midiClock = in Bool()                 // External MIDI clock tick (24 PPQN pulse)
  val config    = in(EnvelopeConfig())      // Packaged register configurations

  // Outputs
  val envelopeOut       = master(Flow(UInt(10 bits))) // Unipolar output (0 to 1023)
  val envelopeOutSigned = master(Flow(SInt(10 bits))) // Bipolar output (-512 to +511)
}
```
* **Unipolar Output (envelopeOut):** Emits unsigned 10-bit values (0 to 1023) for standard amplitude scaling or unipolar modulation. The flow's `valid` signal is synchronized to `phaseTick` (480 kHz heartbeat).
* **Bipolar Output (envelopeOutSigned):** Emits signed 10-bit values (-512 to +511) for ring modulation, phase modulation, or center-zero pitch modulations. The flow's `valid` signal is synchronized to `phaseTick` (480 kHz heartbeat).


### The EnvelopeConfig Bundle
Following the consistent design patterns of the synthesizer's components, the parameter configuration is packaged into a unified Scala bundle under the `synth.common` package:

```scala
case class EnvelopeConfig() extends Bundle {
  val ctrl        = Bits(8 bits)
  val attack      = UInt(8 bits)
  val decay       = UInt(8 bits)
  val sustain     = UInt(8 bits)
  val release     = UInt(8 bits)
  val syncCtrl    = Bits(8 bits)
  val phaseOffset = UInt(8 bits)
}
```

### Register Map
The following registers are mapped into the `spinalSynth` SPI/UART register bus to control the Generator parameters:

| Register Address (Hex) | Register Name | Bit Width | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `0x40` | `ENV_CTRL` | 8 bits | Control bits: `[0]` Enable, `[1]` Gate, `[2]` Loop, `[3]` Ping-Pong, `[4]` Reverse, `[6:5]` Curve Model (`00`=Lin, `01`=Exp, `10`=Log, `11`=S-Curve) |
| `0x41` | `ENV_ATTACK` | 8 bits | Attack rate coefficient (speed of phase accumulator in Attack) |
| `0x42` | `ENV_DECAY` | 8 bits | Decay rate coefficient |
| `0x43` | `ENV_SUSTAIN` | 8 bits | Sustain Level (0 to 255, scaled to 10-bit range internally) |
| `0x44` | `ENV_RELEASE` | 8 bits | Release rate coefficient |
| `0x45` | `ENV_SYNC_CTRL` | 8 bits | Sync config: `[0]` Hard Sync Enable, `[1]` Soft Sync Enable, `[2]` MIDI Sync Enable, `[6:3]` Clock Division Rate |
| `0x46` | `ENV_PHASE_OFFSET`| 8 bits | Phase offset value (0 to 255 representing 0 to 360 degrees) |

## 2. EnvelopeCtrl

`EnvelopeCtrl` is the state machine and synchronization module that determines the active phase increment values and the play direction.

### 2.1 ADSR & Advanced Playback Modes
There is different modes for the ADSR playback envelopes and shapes:
* **Normal (One-Shot):** Triggers on Gate ON, transitions from Attack to Decay to Sustain, and goes to Release on Gate OFF.
* **Reverse (One-Shot):** Reverses the playback of active segments.
* **Ping-Pong Mode (One-Shot):** Playback alternates direction: playing forward (Attack -> Decay) and then reversing (Decay -> Attack in reverse shape). The complete envelop is therefore double the single length.
* **Looping (LFO Mode):** The envelope automatically loops back to the start of the Attack phase once the Decay phase finishes.

```text
  Normal (One-Shot):
   Gate   : ┌────────────────┐
            │                └───────────────────
   Output :   /\_____________
             /  \            \
            /    \____________\
             A   D     S      R

  Reverse (One-Shot):
   Gate   : ┌─────────────┐
            │             └───────────────────
   Output :    _____________/\
             /             /  \
            /_____________/    \
               R      S   D   A

  Ping-Pong (One-Shot):
   Gate   : ┌────────────────────────────────────────────
            │
   Output :   /\    /\
             /  \  /  \
            /    \/    \
             A   D    D   A
             (Forward)  (Reverse)

  Looping (LFO Mode):
   Gate   : ┌────────────────────────────────────────────
            │
   Output :   /\  /\  /\  /\  /\  /\  /\  /\
             /  \/  \/  \/  \/  \/  \/  \/  \ ...
             A   D  A   D  A   D  A   D  A   D

```

### 2.2 Sync and Phase

* **Hard Sync:** An external sync trigger instantly resets the current envelope phase accumulator back to 0 (start of Attack) and restarts the state machine.
* **Soft Sync:** An external sync trigger immediately switches direction to falling (if rising), or scales rate to phase-lock to the trigger frequency without clicky resets.
* **MIDI Sync & Clock Division:** Locks Attack, Decay, and Release times to tempo-subdivisions of MIDI Clock (24 Pulses Per Quarter Note - PPQN), with a 0 to 360-degree Phase Offset.

### 2.3 AD(S)R Lengths: Time Duration Mapping

In synthesizer design, how parameter values map to actual time durations directly determines the musical feel of the instrument. 

#### Why Linear Mapping Fails
If we map the 8-bit parameters (0 to 255) of the Attack, Decay and Release registers to time durations linearly, we encounter severe playing issues:
* **Linear Time Mapping:** If time increases linearly up to 30.0 seconds, the first step is already 117 milliseconds. This completely wipes out the ability to dial in snappy, high-energy percussion attacks (which require precise control between 1 ms and 50 ms).
* **Linear Increment Mapping:** If we instead map the accumulator's step size (increment) linearly, we get a hyperbola where most of the knob range is crammed into tiny millisecond adjustments at the fast end, making it practically impossible to select slow durations with any precision.

#### The Logarithmic Solution
To match human hearing perception for both fast snaps and slow sweeps, we use a **logarithmic time mapping** (exponential increments). This splits the 8-bit parameter range into three playable musical zones:
* **Register Values 0 to 100:** Snappy transients (0.5 ms to 200 ms) with sub-millisecond precision.
* **Register Values 100 to 200:** Medium decay and release controls (200 ms to 3.0 seconds).
* **Register Values 200 to 255:** Very slow, evolving ambient sweeps (3.0 seconds to 30.0 seconds).

#### Hardware Implementation: Pre-Calculated ROM
Calculating logarithmic curves or exponential step values at runtime is expensive in ASIC silicon, requiring division blocks and exponential math units. 

To maintain ASIC portability, we pre-calculate the 256 increment step values in Scala at compile-time. When a parameter register (Attack, Decay, or Release) is written, the system simply uses the 8-bit value to index a highly efficient, static lookup ROM (256 words x 22-bit width) to retrieve the accumulator step size instantly.

```text
System Specifications:
  mainClock        = 24 MHz system clock
  T_min            = 0.5 ms (0.0005 seconds)
  T_max            = 30.0 seconds
  Accumulator Width = 32 bits (10 bits integer + 22 bits fraction)
  Increment Width   = 22 bits

Mathematical Model:
  T(P)             = T_min * (T_max / T_min) ^ (P / 255)
  increment(P)     = 2^32 / (T(P) * 24,000,000)
```

## 3. EnvelopeAccumulator

The `EnvelopeAccumulator` acts as the time-tracking motor of the envelope generator.

### How the Accumulator works
Basically the accumulator is a just register with a fixed width of 32 bits. On every system clock cycle (24MHz), the accumulator adds the selected 22-bit phase increment to its current value. The upper 10 bits of the accumulator are used as the output. These 10 output bits form a ramp function, like a sawtooth wave. The frequency of this ramp is determined by the phase increment value. 

### Clock and Frequency Boundaries
At the 24 MHz main clock rate with a 32-bit accumulator and 22-bit phase increment, the exact operational limits are calculated as follows:

| Target Speed Limit | Time Duration | Active Clock Cycles | Calculated Increment (Decimal) | Increment (Hexadecimal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Maximum Speed (T_min)** | 0.5 milliseconds | 12,000 cycles | **357,914** | 0x05761A |
| **Minimum Speed (T_max)** | 30.0 seconds | 720,000,000 cycles | **6** | 0x000006 |

### Hardware Phase Specifications
* **Accumulator Size:** Uses a 32-bit phase accumulator (10 bits integer + 22 bits fraction).
* **Segment Limits:** When the phase sweeps to its terminal value (overflow, depending on direction), the module asserts the `segmentComplete` flag back to `EnvelopeCtrl` to prompt state transitions.
* **Output Splitting:** Splits the upper 10 integer bits of the active 32-bit phase (bits 31 to 22) into two fields to drive the waveshaper:
  * **Base Index:** The higher 8 bits of the integer part (bits 31 to 24), representing the active step index (0 to 255).
  * **Fractional Part:** The lower 2 bits of the integer part (bits 23 to 22), representing the interpolation fraction (0 to 3).

## 4. EnvelopeShaper

The `EnvelopeShaper` is the output stage of the envelope generator. 

It takes the raw, linear sawtooth ramp output from the accumulator (which always counts from 0 to 1023) and transforms it into musically expressive envelope curves. 

It uses the upper 8-bit to lookup the active curve shape from our small ROM tables, and uses the 2 fractional bits to smoothly fill in the gaps between the data points. All interpolation is performed in pure combinational shift-add logic without any physical multipliers.

Finally, it outputs the unipolar (unsigned Int) and bipolar (signed Int) signals in parallel.

### 4.1 ROM Lookup tables
The higher 8 bits of the 10-bit accumulator output (Base Index) are used as the address to lookup the selected curve shape from our small ROM tables. The curves are pre-calculated as 257-word ROMs (257 x 8 bits) using these profiles:

| Curve Model | Description | Primary Audio Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear (Lin)** | Perfectly straight transition lines. | LFO sweeps, pitch modulation, physical modeling. |
| **Exponential (Exp)** | Accelerating curve start, mimicking natural capacitor discharge. | Snappy percussion envelopes, natural string plucks. |
| **Logarithmic (Log)** | Rapid initial rise followed by gradual flattening. | High-energy attack dynamics, volume compensation. |
| **S-Curve (Sigmoid)** | Smooth cosine-like ease-in and ease-out transitions. | Smooth organic sweeps, cinematic pads, crossfading. |

#### The 257-Entry ROM Boundary Safeguard
To calculate Y1 = LUT[x+1] when the base index is at its boundary (x = 255) without conditional bounds checking or wrapping, the curve ROM is constructed with **257 entries** (indices 0 to 256). For x = 255, LUT[x+1] safely returns LUT[256], containing the true terminal amplitude value.

### 4.2 Hybrid 8+2 Bit Interpolation Math
Using the splits from the 10 bits accumulator output:
* The 8-bit Base Index looks up the boundary values Y0 = LUT[x] and Y1 = LUT[x+1].
* The 2-bit fraction f represents step fractions {0, 1/4, 2/4, 3/4}.
* **Interpolated Output Y:** Y = Y0 + (f / 4) * (Y1 - Y0)

### 4.3 Multiplierless Shift-Add Implementation
The fractional calculation is implemented in pure combinational shift-add logic:

| Fractional Bits (f) | Fraction Value | Hardware Shift-Add Expression |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `00` | 0.00 | Y0 |
| `01` | 0.25 | Y0 + (delta Y >> 2) |
| `10` | 0.50 | Y0 + (delta Y >> 1) |
| `11` | 0.75 | Y0 + (delta Y >> 1) + (delta Y >> 2) |
