## 2. Synth (System Top) Module

### Purpose

The Synth module is the hardware entry point and system integration entity.

The module shall:

- Instantiate UART control (Rx, Decoder, Registers)
- Instantiate the Synthesis Engine (Timing, Oscillator, Output)
- connect subsystem interfaces
- expose the external hardware interface
- contain no DSP or protocol implementation details

### Clocking and Reset

The system operates within a single clock domain managed at the top level:
- **Clock**: 24 MHz external input.
- **Reset**: Asynchronous, Active-High.

### IO Bundle

```
val io = new Bundle {
    val clk        = in Bool()
    val reset      = in Bool()

    val freqWord   = in UInt(24 bits)
    val waveSelect = in UInt(3 bits)
    val pwmWidth   = in UInt(8 bits)

    val i2s_bclk   = out Bool()
    val i2s_lrclk  = out Bool()
    val i2s_sdata  = out Bool()
}
```

## 3. TimingGenerator

### IO Bundle

```scala
val io = new Bundle {

    val phaseTick  = out Bool()
    val sampleTick = out Bool()
}
```

### Internal Structure

| Signal          | Width | Purpose            |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| `phaseCounter`  | 6 bit | modulo-50 counter  |
| `sampleCounter` | 9 bit | modulo-500 counter |

Both counters:

- operate directly from the 24 MHz master clock
- run independently
- are free-running

### Tick Behaviour

Both tick outputs:

- are registered
- synchronous
- one clock cycle wide
- default to `False`

## 4. Uart and Register Bank

This sub-system handles external control, parsing incoming serial data and storing configuration parameters.

### 4.1 UartRx

**Purpose:** Converts the serial UART bitstream into parallel 8-bit bytes. It operates at 115,200 baud using a 208-tick bit period and includes start-bit verification.

### IO Bundle

```scala
val io = new Bundle {
    val rx        = in Bool()
    val data      = out Bits(8 bits)
    val dataValid = out Bool()
}
```

### 4.2 UartProtocolDecoder

**Purpose:** Frames individual bytes into 3-byte command packets: `[Address/Command]`, `[Data]`, and `[Reserved]`. It asserts `writeEnable` only when a full frame is valid.

### IO Bundle

```scala
val io = new Bundle {
    val rxData      = in Bits(8 bits)
    val rxDataValid = in Bool()
    val writeEnable  = out Bool()
    val writeAddress = out UInt(8 bits)
    val writeData    = out Bits(8 bits)
}
```

### 4.3 RegisterBank

**Purpose:** Stores the current state of the synthesizer parameters. It implements an atomic update for the 24-bit frequency word, ensuring all three bytes are applied simultaneously to the DDS engine upon writing to the high-byte address.

### IO Bundle

```scala
val io = new Bundle {
    val writeEnable  = in Bool()
    val writeAddress = in UInt(8 bits)
    val writeData    = in Bits(8 bits)

    val oscFrequency  = out UInt(24 bits)
    val oscWaveform   = out UInt(8 bits)
    val oscPulseWidth = out UInt(8 bits)
    val oscVolume     = out UInt(8 bits)
}
```

## 5. Oscillator

The Oscillator is a module that connects the four submodules, as shown in the following internal submodule structure. It serves as an abstraction layer above the generation of the oscillating audio signals.

### Purpose

Core DDS synthesis engine.

Responsibilities:

- phase accumulation
- waveform generation
- noise generation
- mux between waveforms and noise
- oversampled sample generation

### IO Bundle

```scala
val io = new Bundle {
    val phaseTick = in Bool()
    val freqWord  = in UInt(24 bits)
    val waveSelect = in UInt(3 bits)
    val pwmWidth  = in UInt(8 bits)
    val sample    = out SInt(16 bits)
}
```

### Internal structure of submodules:

```text
Oscillator
 ├── Accumulator
 ├── Noise
 ├── Generators
 └── Mux
```

### 5.1 Oscillator Submodules

#### Accumulator

Responsible for:

- phase register
- phase accumulation
- frequency addition

```scala
val io = new Bundle {
    val phaseTick = in Bool()
    val freqWord  = in UInt(24 bits)
    val phase     = out UInt(24 bits)
}
```

#### Noise

Responsible for:

- LFSR register
- feedback logic
- shift/update logic
- noise sample generation

```scala
val io = new Bundle {
    val phaseTick = in Bool()
    val sample    = out SInt(16 bits)
}
```

#### Generators

Responsible for:

- saw generation
- square generation
- PWM generation
- triangle generation

```scala
val io = new Bundle {
    val phase      = in UInt(24 bits)
    val pwmWidth   = in UInt(8 bits)
    val sawWave    = out SInt(16 bits)
    val squareWave = out SInt(16 bits)
    val pwmWave    = out SInt(16 bits)
    val triWave    = out SInt(16 bits)
}
```

The module shall contain only combinational logic.

#### Mux

Responsible for:

- waveform or noise selection
- final waveform routing

```scala
val io = new Bundle {

    val waveSelect = in UInt(3 bits)
    val sawWave    = in SInt(16 bits)
    val squareWave = in SInt(16 bits)
    val pwmWave    = in SInt(16 bits)
    val triWave    = in SInt(16 bits)
    val noiseWave  = in SInt(16 bits)
    val sample     = out SInt(16 bits)
}
```

### 5.2 Oscillator signal flow

```text
Accumulator ── phase ──┐
                        │
                        ↓
                   Generators
                        │
                        ├── sawWave
                        ├── squareWave
                        ├── pwmWave
                        └── triangleWave

Noise ── noiseSample ───┘
                        ↓
                       Mux
                        ↓
                     sample
```

## 6. Decimator

### IO Bundle

```scala
val io = new Bundle {
    val phaseTick  = in Bool()
    val sampleTick = in Bool()
    val sampleIn   = in SInt(16 bits)
    val sampleOut  = out SInt(16 bits) 
    val valid      = out Bool()
}
```

Responsible for converting the 480 kHz oversampled waveform stream into 48 kHz audio samples. The decimator captures every 10th oscillator sample.

sampleOut is:

- registered
- stable
- updated only at 48 kHz

valid communicates that a new 48 kHz sample is available now.

## 7. I2STransmitter

### IO Bundle

```scala
val io = new Bundle {
    val sampleIn  = in SInt(16 bits)
    val valid     = in Bool()
    val bclk      = out Bool()
    val lrclk     = out Bool()
    val sdata     = out Bool()
}
```

Self-contained serializer and protocol engine.

Responsibilities:

- BCLK generation
- LRCLK generation
- shift register control
- stereo frame timing
- serial audio output

The module operates directly from the 24 MHz master clock.

The serializer uses the scheduled timing subpattern:

```text
16,16,15,16,16,15,16,15
```

to generate the required average I²S bit timing.

### 7.1 Gated Startup and Idle State

The transmitter employs a gated startup mechanism to ensure that 
the I2S clock and data lines only toggle when valid audio data is present.

**Idle Behavior:**
The transmitter starts in an inactive state after reset:
- `bclk` and `sdata` are held `Low`.
- `lrclk` is held `High` (the standard idle state for I2S).

**Activation:**
The state machine transitions to `active` upon the first assertion of `io.valid`. On this cycle:
- Internal counters (`bitCounter`, `cycleCounter`, `patternIndex`) are reset to `0`.
- The input sample is latched into the `sampleBuffer`.
- The `shiftRegister` is loaded, and transmission of the Left channel begins immediately.

Once active, the transmitter remains in the active state to maintain a continuous bit clock, even 
if subsequent `valid` pulses are delayed, though it will re-synchronize its frame boundaries 
to the `valid` signal to prevent drift.
